## Supply Chain DApp

This project contains a Solidity smart contract and a React front-end for managing a decentralised supply chain. Key features include:

- Add new products with unique identifiers.
- Transfer ownership between addresses.
- Update the stage of a product (Created, InTransit, Delivered).
- Query product details by ID.

### Setup

1. Install dependencies in `supply-chain` and `supply-chain/client` directories (requires internet access):
   ```bash
   cd supply-chain
   npm install
   npx hardhat compile
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Use MetaMask to interact with the deployed contract.

Due to network restrictions in this environment, package installation and contract compilation could not be executed.
